## Specifics About This Infrastructure

+ The addition of a firewall between each server.<br/>This protects each server from unwanted and unauthorized users rather than protecting a single server.

## Issues With This Infrastructure

+ High maintenance costs.<br/>Moving each of the major components to its own server, means that more servers would have to be bought and the electricity bill would rise along with the introduction of new servers.
